# Biomedical Research Integrity Pre-submission Audit

## Scope

- Mode: internal_presubmission
- Package root: /Users/rosscai/Documents/biomed-research-integrity-auditor/evals/cases/case_019

## Audit Coverage

Modules executed in this run:

- statistics_consistency
- pseudoreplication
- package_internal_text_overlap

Modules not executed in this run:

- image screening (no image files supplied)
- external literature phrase search (offline: private internal audit, or no provider/fixture)
- methodology/reporting-standard compliance (ARRIVE/CONSORT/ICMJE/MIFlowCyt/omics accession): guided checklist, not auto-screened

- Image panels screened: 0
- Source-data tables screened: 1

> A module with no findings means no candidate was detected within the current detector scope and supplied materials; it is not a guarantee of correctness. Methodology and reporting-standard compliance (ARRIVE/CONSORT/ICMJE/MIFlowCyt/omics accession) and exhaustive external plagiarism-database search are not performed automatically and require human review.

## Missing Materials Matrix

| Category | Risk | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ethics_irb | R1 | No files classified as ethics_irb. |
| figure_assembly | R1 | No files classified as figure_assembly. |
| figures | R1 | No files classified as figures. |
| protocols | R1 | No files classified as protocols. |
| raw_images | R1 | No files classified as raw_images. |
| supplementary | R1 | No files classified as supplementary. |

## Risk Register

| Finding ID | Risk | Module | Location | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BIOMED-STAT-0001 | R2 | stats.consistency_check | Figure_11_integer_count_summary.csv:row2:group=Control | Integer-count mean/SD/n combination appears mathematically incompatible |

## Evidence Ledger

### BIOMED-STAT-0001

- Risk Level: R2
- Module: stats.consistency_check
- Location: Figure_11_integer_count_summary.csv:row2:group=Control
- Finding Type: Integer-count mean/SD/n combination appears mathematically incompatible
- Evidence: `{"message": "Integer-count mean/SD/n combination appears mathematically incompatible", "evidence_type": "statistics_consistency", "reason": "mean * n is not an integer for an integer-count outcome", "mean": 2.25, "n": 6, "mean_times_n": 13.5, "mean_half_ulp": 0.005, "feasible_sum_range": [13.47, 13.53], "minimum_n_for_automatic_check": 6}`
- Benign explanations considered: rounding, normalization, export, or reporting differences may explain the observation, source/raw records and analysis code are needed before escalation
- Required materials to resolve: source data, raw records where applicable, analysis file or code
- Recommended action: Inspect source data, analysis code, rounding, normalization, and benign explanations.
- Note: Calibrated from detector candidate; not a misconduct verdict.

## Boundary

This report identifies research-integrity risks and completeness gaps. It does not determine misconduct, intent, or author guilt.
